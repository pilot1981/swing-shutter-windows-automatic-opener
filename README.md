# swing-windows-opener
This repository contain all you need to create from scratch a swing windows opener Apple Homekit opener: from mechanical to electronical parts.

This project would help everyone to create itself an automated swing window opener using modern vocie assistant at lowest price (in Italy commercial product have a price of 500â‚¬ for each window, and there isn't a commercial product able to communicate with Alexa, Google Home and Apple HomeKit)

Requirements:
- manage power on n.2 DC Motor 24VDC?;
- delay in opening and closing: when opening, first open right window and then left window; when closing first close left window and then right window;
- opening/closing slowdown;
- 2 motor to open swing windows at 180 degree
- End of stroke of the motors should be controlled measuring the current or power
- 230 VAC
- control using Apple HomeKit via WiFi using ESP82xx
- not use 433 MHz
- manual motor release
- metal box to install DC motor, electronic mainboard
- littel space to install between external and internal window

OPTIONAL:
- solar panels
- wall button

BOM:
- n.2 metal crank mechanism to connect DC motor to windows
- n.2 DC motor 24VDC
- n.1 power supply 220V->24VDC
- n.2 metal engine support?
- n.4 end of stroke (micro-switch?)
- n.1 metal box
- electronic for control delay and PM
- ESP8266 con modulo WIFI
- DUAL CONTROL DRIVER L298N (Max 2A) oppure POLOLU (Max 5A) control driver H-BRIDGE????
