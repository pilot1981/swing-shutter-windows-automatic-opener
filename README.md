# swing-windows-opener
This repository contain all you need to create from scratch a swing dual external shutter windows opener Apple Homekit opener: from mechanical to electronical parts.

This project would help everyone to create itself an automated swing shutter window opener using modern vocie assistant at lowest price (in Italy commercial product have a price of 500â‚¬ for each window, and there isn't a commercial product able to communicate with Alexa, Google Home and Apple HomeKit)

REQUIREMENTS FOR FIRST VERSION:
- opener for 2 doors
- max/min dimensions of shutter windows ????
- manage power on n.2 DC Motor 24VDC?;
- delay in opening and closing: when opening, first open right window and then left window; when closing first close left window and then right window;
- opening/closing slowdown;
- 2 motor to open swing windows at 180 degree
- End of stroke of the motors should be controlled measuring the current or power
- 230 VAC
- control using Apple HomeKit via WiFi using ESP82xx
- not use 433 MHz
- manual motor release from internal of house for emergency
- irreversible engine
- metal box to install DC motor, electronic mainboard
- little space to install between external and internal window
- installatin in top of existing window
- protection IP24 or IP44???

OPTIONAL FOR NEXT/ADVANCED VERSION:
- simplest version for 1 door
- close sensor
- open sensor
- solar panels similar to it https://ducatihome.it/collections/persy/products/persy-sol
- battery similar to it https://ducatihome.it/collections/persy/products/bat-0212
- wall button
- control using Alexa, Google Home
- detection obstacle, wind, ice (suing PM, contact, motion detection, ...)
- adapt to other type of windows (padovana, trevigiana, vicentina, vicentina rovesciata, libro)
- anti-crushing system
- lock mechanism similar to it https://ducatihome.it/collections/persy/products/persy-lock https://ducatihome.it/collections/persy/products/persy-block


BOM:
- n.2 metal crank mechanism to connect DC motor to windows similar to it https://ducatihome.it/collections/persy/products/arko-2
- n.2 DC motor 24VDC
- n.1 power supply 220V->24VDC
- n.2 metal engine support?
- n.4 end of stroke (micro-switch?)
- n.1 metal box
- electronic for control delay and PM
- ESP8266 con modulo WIFI
- DUAL CONTROL DRIVER L298N (Max 2A) oppure POLOLU (Max 5A) control driver H-BRIDGE????

TODO LIST:
1) buy list of materials
2) assembler all-in-one solution
3) we have 2 ways to automate a self made swing window opener: 1) use a commercial garage swing gate opener + ESP82xx with 1 relay dry contact without PM , with HAA firmware; 2) use an unique PCB with ESP82xx, 4 relay 24VDC, PM features, ... with HAA firmware

PHASE OF THIS PROJECT:
1) documentation (actual)
2) prototype and test (next 3 months)
3) production/final release (next 6 months)
